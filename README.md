# L4D1&2 Signatures
A repository for hosting several L4D1&2 signatures.

More signatures will be added and supported as I come across or use more functions.

I will try my best to keep all the signatures in this repository up-to-date.

If you want me to add/support any function that isn't in this repository already, file an issue.

If you have some signatures you want to share, make a pull request.
